// which option is correct:
// 1. there is no loss of value as the lastTravelledOn and dateofTravel are printed correctly.
// 2. the loss of value for lastTravelledOn and dateofTravel keys can be prevented if object.assign(this) is used instead of JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(this));

// option 2 is correct as 
//    -> JSON.stringify() does not handle Date objects as regular JavaScript objects
//    -> object is serialized using JSON.stringify(), the key-value pairs where the value is undefined 
//        are dropped from the resulting JSON string

//    -> Object.assign(this) is a shallow copy method. When you use Object.assign(), 
//        it will copy primitive values (like strings, numbers, and undefined values) 
//        and references (like objects, arrays, and functions) from the original object to the target object.
//           -> e.g., For Date objects, since the Date object is copied by reference, 
//               the date information will not be lost, and no time zone conversion or loss of data will occur.
//           -> If the lastTravelledOn key is undefined, it will remain undefined in the cloned object, 
//               instead of being dropped.

 * 
 * 
 *  Key Points to Keep in Mind to Avoid This Issue
        Time Zone Handling in JavaScript: 
            JavaScript internally stores dates in UTC. 
            Any manipulation, serialization, or deserialization of Date objects might cause the time zone to shift, 
            depending on how the date is created, formatted, and logged.

        Serializing Date Objects: 
            When using JSON.stringify(), Date objects are automatically converted into ISO 8601 strings 
            (which are in UTC). If you plan to send a Date object to a server or store it in a database, 
            this is usually a good practice because it standardizes the representation. 
            However, when you later parse that string using JSON.parse(), 
            the time zone may shift if itâ€™s interpreted incorrectly in your local environment.

        Local Time Zone Considerations: 
            If you need to preserve the exact local time zone when working with Date objects, 
            consider explicitly formatting or storing the time zone offset along with the Date 
            (e.g., storing Date as a string with both the date and time zone).

        Best Practices:

            Convert the Date to a string in the desired format (e.g., toLocaleString() or toISOString()) 
            when logging or displaying it.
            Store and handle time zone offsets manually if precise local time handling is needed.
