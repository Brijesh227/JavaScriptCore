1. When you work with multiple promise then only first is executed.
2. Always use resolve or reject from promise else await code never executes and keep waiting.
    await is only waiting for block of promise, do not wait in global scope.
3. loop that work with async/await:
    for (const p of promises) {}
    for (let i=0;i<promises.length;i++) {}

4. loops that not work with async/await:
    forEach
    map
