Everything in javascript happens inside an "Execution Context".

Javascript is synchronous single-threaded language.

how below code executed?
var n = 2;
function square(num){      //num = parameter
    var ans = num * num;
    return ans;
}
var square4 = square(4);  // 4 = arguments

1. memory phase:(compile time)
    n: undefined
    square: {...} // whole code
    square4: undefined

2. code Execution:(run time)
    when new function is called it create it's own execution context.


JavaScript is considered an interpreted, dynamically typed language, 
but it also employs JIT compilation for performance optimization. 
It doesnâ€™t require explicit compilation like C or Java. 


Its type system is dynamic, meaning types are checked at runtime, and variables can change their type.

Static typing means that the type of a variable is known at compile-time instead of at runtime(typescript)
