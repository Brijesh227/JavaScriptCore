Browser working:

    DOM generation:
        load file
            |
        raw bytes
            |
        character encoding(UTF-8) -> token -> h1,p,html
            |
        Relation
            |
          Nodes
            |
           DOM

    CSSOM generation:
        Raw -> character encoding(UTF-8) -> token -> object -> Relation -> model(CSSOM)
        
    Render Tree:
        DOM + CSSOM -> Render Tree

Relations between v8,libuv and event loop
JavaScript Code (run by V8) 
       |
Asynchronous Operation (e.g., I/O)
       |
       v
libuv (handles I/O, uses internal thread pool)
       |
Event Loop (part of libuv, manages execution of callbacks)
       |
JavaScript Callbacks (executed by V8)
